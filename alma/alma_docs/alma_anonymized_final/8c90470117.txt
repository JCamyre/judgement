Dear Sir or Madam:

This letter is written as my strongest recommendation for Mr. Arjun Patil, an individual of extraordinary ability as a data science engineer. I had the unique privilege of working closely with Mr. Patil while he was pursuing his education in Computer Science at Columbia University and can attest to his remarkable capabilities and expertise in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).

As a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Columbia University and the new co-director of the Columbia Center for Cybersecurity, I have extensive experience in the fields of computer security, privacy, and machine learning. My research primarily focuses on empirically measuring the security and privacy of technology systems and their intersections with society, with particular attention to safeguarding online ecosystems. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I was a member of the Center for Automotive Embedded Systems Security and participated in one of the first security analyses of a modern automobile. Currently, my research includes online payment systems, the economics of cybercrime, automotive systems, privacy-enhancing technologies, and censorship resistance.

In addition to my academic roles, I co-founded Cybersecurity for Democracy, a multi-university, nonpartisan research project of the Columbia Center for Cybersecurity dedicated to exposing disinformation and other online threats while recommending countermeasures. In recent years, the team has analyzed online hate and harassment networks targeting election officials, devised ways of preventing tech-fueled political violence, investigated political ad spending, and studied the influence of social media platforms on teens, among other critical issues. Before my current role at Columbia, I served as an Associate Professor and Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Columbia, a Research Staff Member at the International Computer Science Institute, and an Assistant Professor at Fairfax University. Throughout my career, I have published numerous papers in top-tier computer science conferences and journals, showcasing my expertise in the field. This extensive background, along with mentoring countless students over the years, has endowed me with a keen eye for identifying exceptional talent. Among the many students I have encountered, Mr. Arjun Patil has always stood out as truly extraordinary.

Mr. Patil and I began working closely together in June 2018 on our highly crucial Online Political Ads Transparency Project, which aimed to detect election fraud. During this time, Mr. Patil proved to be an irreplaceable team member, expertly analyzing a large dataset of over 1.3 million political ads collected from Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Prior to joining this project, Mr. Patil had already displayed remarkable abilities through a prior project as a Research Assistant at the Center for Cybersecurity at Columbia. Under the guidance of Professor Justin Collins, he worked on further securing automobile updates through the project Uptane. He utilized Python to implement hybrid encryption (RSA and AES-128) to encrypt updates and integrated security features to defend against attack vectors from compromised repositories. Moreover, he increased test coverage for Uptane by 5%. Additionally, he researched innovative techniques to build a compromise-resilient framework for updating IoT devices in the medical industry and Industrial Control Systems. Mr. Patil also contributed to redesigning the graduate-level course Application Security, offered both online and in-person to over 1,000 students at Columbia. His outstanding performance in these roles was a major reason I brought him onto the political ads project, confident in his ability to handle its complexities and challenges.

In the Online Political Ads Transparency Project, Mr. Patil's contributions were nothing short of extraordinary, particularly for a young researcher at the early stages of his career. He meticulously scraped and analyzed political advertisements released on social media websites using Python, successfully gathering over 500,000 unique ads stored in a PostgreSQL database. This immense task, handled with incredible precision and efficiency, provided a robust foundation for the project's findings. Demonstrating remarkable foresight, Mr. Patil open-sourced this data and our findings, making them accessible for further research and public scrutiny—an invaluable contribution to the field.

Additionally, Mr. Patil co-authored the related publication "An Analysis of United States Online Political Advertising Transparency" with me, cementing his status as a published researcher in a highly impactful study. Our paper analyzed over 1.3 million political ads and revealed critical insights into how different types of political advertisers disseminate U.S. political messages on Facebook, Google, and Twitter. We discovered that these ads generated between 8.67 billion to 33.8 billion impressions and that sponsors spent over $300 million USD on them. Our findings highlighted the significant presence of quasi for-profit media companies that create deceptive online communities, exploiting the lower regulatory requirements of online platforms compared to traditional media.

Mr. Patil's technical prowess and innovative thinking were further evidenced by his development of a custom labeling tool using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool was specifically tailored for our dataset and significantly increased our labeling efficiency by over 500% through crowdsourcing efforts. Notably, our paper has been cited 62 times to date by prominent researchers, further demonstrating its impact in the field. For instance, it has been referenced in works on political advertising by EF Fowler et al. in the American Political Science Review, on ad delivery algorithms by M Ali et al. in the ACM Conference, and on Facebook's ad targeting systems by K Cotter et al. in Big Data & Society. The widespread recognition and citation of our research underscore its importance and the impressive quality of Mr. Patil’s contributions.

The impact of our research, much of which can be attributed to Mr. Patil's diligence and expertise, was widely recognized and featured in prestigious media outlets. For example, it was highlighted in The Washington Post article "The Biggest Spender of Political Ads on Facebook? President Trump," as well as in pieces by CNBC and Fortune. His contributions played a pivotal role in the project's success, demonstrating his extraordinary capabilities as a researcher and technologist.

Since the conclusion of our project, I have followed Mr. Patil's career with great interest and am not surprised by his continued success. Given his remarkable skills and dedication, it was evident to me that he would go on to make significant contributions in his field. I understand that he has applied his expertise in machine learning and data science to combat fraud and abuse at leading companies like Orion and VentureTech. His ability to tackle complex problems and his commitment to technological advancement have undoubtedly driven his impressive career trajectory, confirming the high potential I saw in him early on.

Most recently, Mr. Patil has embarked on an ambitious new venture by founding Quantum Innovations, a cutting-edge startup focused on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for innovative solutions. As someone deeply engaged in research related to cybersecurity, privacy, measurement, networking, and emerging media, I recognize the groundbreaking potential of their flagship product, VoiceBridge. As the Chief Technology Officer, Mr. Patil is spearheading the development of speech-to-speech synthesis models designed to make offshore Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) sound American. By using AI and data science, VoiceBridge aims to improve the sales process for teams that rely on offshore sales representatives, enhancing communication effectiveness and efficiency and ultimately boosting sales performance. This pioneering product not only reflects Mr. Patil's profound expertise but also his ability to innovate and address complex industry challenges.
