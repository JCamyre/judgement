Dear Officer:

I write this letter as a strong recommendation on behalf of Mr. Lucas Brown, particularly in the context of his extraordinary abilities and contributions as a research engineer in the field of adaptive neuro-engineered AI systems.

As a Global Partner and Co-Head of Capital Origination and Investor Relations at Launchpad, I have extensive experience working with entrepreneurs and startups. Launchpad is a global early-stage venture capital firm that operates in 25 locations across six continents. Our mission is to invest in and support the world's most exceptional people building the defining companies of tomorrow.

Prior to joining Launchpad, I held senior roles at leading financial institutions such as Chase Bank and Royal Bank. My experience spans investment management, private banking, and corporate strategy. I am a Fellow Chartered Accountant (ICAEW) and hold an LLB (Hons) in Law and German from the University of the West of England.

In my role at Launchpad, I have gained significant insight into the qualities and characteristics that define successful entrepreneurs. Our global startup generator and early-stage venture capital firm aims to support exceptional talent in building transformative companies. With a presence in major cities worldwide, including the United States, Launchpad has developed a comprehensive program to identify and nurture promising founders.

The Launchpad Founder in Residence program starts with a rigorous selection process, evaluating applicants based on their skills, experience, and the potential of their business ideas. Successful candidates are then invited to join a cohort of like-minded entrepreneurs. During the program, participants have the opportunity to find co-founders, validate their ideas, and develop their business concepts. Launchpad provides a range of resources, including mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs and industry experts, and access to a global network of advisors and investors.

As participants progress through the program, the most promising startups receive pre-seed funding to help further develop their businesses. Launchpad's investment approach is designed to provide early-stage companies with the capital and support they need to achieve product-market fit and prepare for future growth.
