Dear Officer: 

My name is Nikita Kaur, and I am a Managing Partner at VentureFirst, a $300M venture fund focused on pre-seed stage startups. I have extensive experience identifying and supporting exceptional founders at the earliest stages of their entrepreneurial journeys. VentureFirst operates a highly selective Founder in Residence program, which provides funding, resources, and hands-on guidance to a small group of 5-8 high-caliber founders per batch. Through this program, we have helped numerous startups achieve rapid product-market fit and prepare for successful Series A rounds.

Prior to VentureFirst, I served as an early Product Manager at SocialHub, where I played an instrumental role in launching the company's first advertising products, which quickly grew to generate hundreds of millions in annual revenue. I also held key roles at Foundation Investments, MediaTech, and AdWorks, focusing on product strategy, marketing, and business development for various digital advertising initiatives.

My educational background includes a BS in Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and an MBA from Harvard Business School. This combination of technical expertise and business acumen has equipped me with the skills to assess founders' capabilities across both dimensions.

Throughout my career, I have been recognized as an innovator and thought leader in the tech industry. I am listed as an inventor on a predictive algorithm patent and have been invited to present at prestigious conferences such as the Tech Innovators Conference, Digital Marketing Symposium, and AI Trends Summit. These experiences, along with my role at VentureFirst, have given me unique insights into the qualities and achievements that distinguish truly impressive founders. It is through this lens that I have had the opportunity to work closely with Mr. Rohan Patel and observe his immense potential firsthand.

Earlier this year, Mr. Rohan Patel and his venture, Innovate Tech, were selected to participate in VentureFirst's highly competitive Founder-in-Residence (FIR) program. This esteemed program only accepts between 5 to 8 founders or teams per batch, chosen from a large pool of exceptional applicants. The rigorous selection process evaluates candidates based on their prior experience, notable accomplishments, and potential to innovate and iterate on their ideas.

Over the course of the 10-week program, Mr. Patel had unparalleled access to our network comprising over 10,000 potential customers and design partners. The FIR program also offered weekly product demonstrations, fireside chats with seasoned advisors and founders, and one-on-one mentorship. These resources were meticulously designed to help founders generate momentum, build accountability, and draw insights from other exceptional entrepreneurs.

In addition to Rohan's participation in our Founder-in-Residence program, VentureFirst made a substantial investment of $500,000 in his company, Innovate Tech LLC. This investment decision followed an exhaustive due diligence process that involved evaluating the company’s technology, market potential, and Mr. Patel’s abilities as a founder. The investment amount is significant, underscoring VentureFirst's confidence in Rohan's vision and his capability to steer his innovative company towards success.

As an early-stage venture capital firm, VentureFirst is highly selective in its investments. We typically invest in pre-seed stage companies led by impressive founders with the potential to make a significant impact in their respective fields. Our investment in Innovate Tech reflects our strong belief in Mr. Patel's technical expertise, leadership skills, and capacity to drive meaningful innovation.

Innovate Tech, under the visionary leadership of Mr. Patel, is focused on transforming the efficiency and effectiveness of business development through their innovative real-time voice engine. By leveraging advanced AI, their technology enables offshore Business Development Representatives (BDRs) to sound American on cold calls, thereby improving trust and credibility. This breakthrough solution aims to significantly enhance the conversion rate of cold calls, enabling businesses to close more deals and ultimately increase revenue. With this targeted approach, Innovate Tech is set to redefine how companies engage with potential clients, driving both innovation and substantial business growth.

As the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of Innovate Tech, Mr. Patel plays a crucial role in defining and driving the overall technical strategy, ensuring it aligns with business goals. He makes key decisions on technology adoption and presents the vision to stakeholders, seamlessly integrating technical aspirations with business objectives. Overseeing the product lifecycle from concept to launch, Mr. Patel works closely with the CEO to define roadmaps, prioritize features, and translate business requirements into technical specifications. His expertise extends to designing the system architecture, making critical decisions on the tech stack, and leading hands-on development efforts.

His ability to tackle complex technical challenges head-on and develop innovative solutions is crucial to overcoming obstacles in product development and system performance. Furthermore, he is responsible for identifying, assessing, and mitigating technology-related risks, overseeing the company's cybersecurity strategy, ensuring regulatory compliance, and implementing disaster recovery plans.

Having had the opportunity to be part of two foundational internet companies—AdWorks, which invented search ads, and SocialHub, which transformed communications—I understand the profound impact that innovative technology can have on an industry. At AdWorks, SocialHub, and even MediaTech in between, I enjoyed the process of transforming interesting ideas into features, products, and, in SocialHub's case, a business. The most rewarding aspect is collaborating with smart, driven entrepreneurs who are solving fundamental problems. Working with Mr. Patel and Innovate Tech has been a similar experience. I have been impressed by their keen understanding of the business development space and their ability to harness AI to address real-world challenges. Their dedication to enhancing trust and efficiency in cold calling is not only innovative but transformative. I am excited to see how Innovate Tech will continue to evolve and contribute to the industry, and I look forward to being part of their journey as they build something truly remarkable.

Prior to founding Innovate Tech, Mr. Patel held several roles that highlight his extraordinary ability as a data science engineer in the fields of deep learning and AI.

In this role, he applied his advanced skills in data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the platform's safety and security measures.

As a Software Engineer at FinTech Solutions from 2021 to 2023, Mr. Patel was instrumental in developing innovative solutions for corporate expense management and financial analytics. His contributions were pivotal, helping the company boost its adjusted gross transaction volume from $1K to an impressive $500M, and reducing loss rates from 6% to 1%. These achievements underscore his exceptional ability to craft and implement impactful financial technology solutions.

Mr. Patel also demonstrated his remarkable research capabilities at the University of Alberta and New York Institute of Technology. As a Machine Learning Researcher at the University of Alberta from 2019 to 2021, he developed advanced techniques to detect cybersecurity threats and analyzed emotional distress in vocal patterns, achieving high accuracy rates. At New York Institute of Technology, from 2018 to 2019, Mr. Patel worked as a Data Scientist, where he utilized data scraping and machine learning techniques to analyze campaign advertising data on social media and detect potential election fraud.

Throughout his career, Mr. Patel has consistently demonstrated an extraordinary ability to apply his technical expertise to solve complex problems and drive meaningful results. His extensive experience in data science, machine learning, and software engineering, coupled with his impressive track record of delivering impactful solutions, positions him as a leading and invaluable contributor to the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning.
