RE: Recommendation Letter for Rohan Patel's O-1 Visa Petition

Dear USCIS Officer:

I am writing to provide my strongest recommendation for Rohan Patel's O-1A visa petition. As the Managing Partner at VentureFirst, a $300M venture fund focused on pre-seed stage startups, I have had the opportunity to closely observe Rohan's work as a participant in our highly selective Founder in Residence program. In this letter, I will present factual evidence of Rohan's achievements that demonstrate his eligibility for the O-1A visa classification.

[Recommender Background]

As the Managing Partner at VentureFirst, a $300M venture fund focused on pre-seed stage startups, I have extensive experience identifying and supporting exceptional founders at the earliest stages of their entrepreneurial journeys. VentureFirst operates a highly selective Founder in Residence program, which provides funding, resources, and hands-on guidance to a small group of 5-8 high-caliber founders per batch. Through this program, we have helped numerous startups achieve rapid product-market fit and prepare for successful Series A rounds.

Prior to VentureFirst, I served as an early Product Manager at SocialHub, where I played an instrumental role in launching the company's first advertising products, which quickly grew to generate hundreds of millions in annual revenue. I also held key roles at Foundation Investments, MediaTech, and AdWorks, focusing on product strategy, marketing, and business development for various digital advertising initiatives.

My educational background includes a BS in Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and an MBA from Harvard Business School. This combination of technical expertise and business acumen has equipped me with the skills to assess founders' capabilities across both dimensions.

Throughout my career, I have been recognized as an innovator and thought leader in the tech industry. I am listed as an inventor on a predictive algorithm patent and have been invited to present at prestigious conferences such as the Tech Innovators Conference, Digital Marketing Symposium, and AI Trends Summit.

These experiences, along with my role at VentureFirst, have given me unique insights into the qualities and achievements that distinguish truly exceptional founders. It is through this lens that I have had the opportunity to work closely with Rohan Patel and observe his immense potential firsthand.
