PII collaborates with Valley University to provide opportunities for select teams to participate in the esteemed Hero Training Program in Silicon Valley.

Prior to my current role, I served as an Advisor to the Mayor of Capital City from 2015 to 2018. In this capacity, I contributed to the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting Capital City's growth as a hub for innovation. I supported initiatives designed to create a conducive environment for startups and worked to strengthen the city's ties with the global technology community.

My educational background in Public Administration and Political Science, with degrees from Coastal University and Riverwood University, has equipped me with a deep understanding of policy development and governance. I am passionate about leveraging this expertise to drive positive change and support the growth of the technology sector. To further enhance my knowledge and skills, I am scheduled to begin additional studies in Public Administration at the Urban University in August 2024.

These competencies, along with my extensive experience in government and entrepreneurial ventures, enable me to effectively evaluate and support individuals like Olivia who demonstrate extraordinary potential in their fields.

[Recommender's Relationship With Olivia Chen]

My relationship with Olivia Chen began when she was selected to participate in the PII x Hero Training Program at Valley University in the summer of 2023. As the Chief Administration Officer at PII, I played a role in facilitating this collaboration between our organization and Valley University. The program, which ran from May 22, 2023, to June 23, 2023, provided a unique opportunity for promising entrepreneurs like Olivia to receive training and support in Silicon Valley.

During the program, I had the opportunity to interact with Olivia and observe her engagement with the various workshops, mentorship sessions, and networking events. While I did not work with her directly on a day-to-day basis, I was able to form a positive impression of her dedication and enthusiasm for learning and growth. Olivia actively participated in the program activities and sought to make the most of the resources and connections available to her.

Through our limited interactions and the feedback received from program organizers, it was evident that Olivia demonstrated a strong work ethic and a genuine passion for entrepreneurship.
