Re: I-130 Petition for Alien Relative
Petitioner: Sarah Johnson
Beneficiary: Alejandro Garcia

Dear USCIS Officer,

I am writing on behalf of my client, Ms. Sarah Johnson, in connection with the I-130 Petition for Alien Relative filed on behalf of her spouse, Mr. Alejandro Garcia. We are respectfully requesting your favorable consideration of this petition.

Background Information
Ms. Johnson, a U.S. citizen by birth, met Mr. Garcia during a work conference in Brazil in 2019. The couple maintained a long-distance relationship for two years before getting married on June 15, 2022, in Rio de Janeiro. They have since maintained a genuine marital relationship, as evidenced by the documentation provided with the initial filing.

Relationship and Eligibility
Ms. Johnson and Mr. Garcia have provided substantial evidence to demonstrate the legitimacy of their marriage. This includes joint bank account statements, a residential lease agreement in both names, and affidavits from family and friends attesting to their relationship. Additionally, they have submitted photographs of their wedding and subsequent vacations, illustrating their life together.

Mr. Garcia has no criminal record and has never violated U.S. immigration laws. He has maintained lawful status during his visits to the United States and has complied with all relevant legal requirements.

Financial Support and Stability
Ms. Johnson, who works as a Senior Marketing Specialist at Future Innovations Ltd., has sufficient income to meet the requirements of the affidavit of support (Form I-864). Her employment is stable, and she has included evidence of her income, including tax returns for the past three years, recent pay stubs, and a letter of employment verification.

Hardship Considerations
Should Mr. Garcia's petition not be approved, it would result in extreme hardship for Ms. Johnson. The couple has invested significantly in their life together in the United States, where they plan to raise a family. Ms. Johnson would suffer not only financially but emotionally, as the separation from her spouse would be detrimental to her well-being.

Request for Expedited Processing
Given the unique circumstances of this case, we respectfully request that USCIS expedite the processing of this petition. Mr. Garcia has been offered a position as a systems analyst at a leading technology firm in Los Angeles, which will greatly benefit the U.S. economy and contribute to his family's stability in the United States.

Conclusion
In conclusion, Ms. Johnson and Mr. Garcia have demonstrated that they meet all the legal requirements for the approval of this I-130 petition. They are a genuine couple who have built a life together and are eager to continue doing so in the United States. We ask that you grant this petition and allow Mr. Garcia to join his spouse without further delay.

Thank you for your time and consideration. If you require any additional information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact our office.

Sincerely,

Jessica Miller
