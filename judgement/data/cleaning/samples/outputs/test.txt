Re: I-130 Petition for Alien Relative
Petitioner: Sarah Miller
Beneficiary: Luis Garcia

Dear USCIS Officer,

I am writing on behalf of my client, Ms. Sarah Miller, in connection with the I-130 Petition for Alien Relative that has been submitted for her spouse, Mr. Luis Garcia. We respectfully request your favorable review and approval of this petition.

Background Overview
Ms. Miller, a natural-born U.S. citizen, met Mr. Garcia in 2019 during a business trip to Spain. Their relationship blossomed despite the distance, and they sustained a long-distance relationship for two years. On July 10, 2022, they were married in Madrid. Since their marriage, Ms. Miller and Mr. Garcia have continued to nurture a bona fide marital relationship, substantiated by the comprehensive documentation provided with their initial petition.

Relationship Evidence and Eligibility
The couple has provided ample evidence to support the authenticity of their marriage. This includes joint financial documents such as bank account statements and a residential lease in both their names. Additionally, they have submitted affidavits from family and friends affirming their relationship. Photographs of their wedding and shared 
vacations further illustrate the depth and sincerity of their life together.

Mr. Garcia maintains a clean legal record and has never violated any U.S. immigration laws. He has always adhered to legal requirements during his visits to the United States, ensuring lawful status at all times.

Financial Stability and Support
Ms. Miller is employed as a Senior Marketing Manager at Tech Innovations Ltd., where she has a stable and well-paying job. She meets the income requirements for the affidavit of support (Form I-864) and has provided evidence of her financial capability, including her tax returns for the past three years, recent pay stubs, and a letter confirming her employment status.

Consideration of Hardship
Should this petition be denied, Ms. Miller would face significant hardship. The couple has deeply invested in building their life in the United States, where they intend to raise a family. The emotional and financial toll on Ms. Miller would be considerable, as separation from her spouse would cause severe distress.

Request for Expedited Processing
Given the particular circumstances of this case, we request expedited processing of this petition. Mr. Garcia has received a job offer as a software engineer from a prominent technology firm in Austin, a role that not only benefits his family but also contributes positively to the U.S. economy.

Conclusion
Ms. Miller and Mr. Garcia have clearly demonstrated their eligibility for approval of this I-130 petition. They are a genuine couple who have built a life together and wish to continue doing so in the United States. We kindly request that you approve this petition promptly, allowing Mr. Garcia to join his spouse without unnecessary delay.    

We appreciate your time and consideration. Should you require any additional information or documentation, please feel free to contact our office.

Sincerely,

Angela Johnson
